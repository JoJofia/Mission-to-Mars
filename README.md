# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
This is a webscraping project. We try to retrieve the data from Mars such as information and pictures that all relate to Mars. And we need to build up a portfolio for Robin to show her motivation and enthusiasm with her web app.

## Object
In the project, we use different tools (Python, Jupyter note and mongoDB etc) to help us to scrape from various websites. At first, we collect huge data without any structured database from MongoDB. Then set up the Flask and run the scraping that we build, save the code in the database. After the database created, we retrieve the code for a webpage that set up the structure can run in HTML index.
